What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates a .git file in that folder. 
	You have to do it to be able to make commits on git for files in that folder. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? 
	The staging area allows you to group more than one file together or to let you only work with one file instaed of all of them. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? 
	It allows you to choose specific files you would like to commit to. 
	Has colours to indicate which files have been modified. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? how would branches help?
	When you want to have 2 versions of the same project you will be able to work on each branch easily without worring about changing any files from the main file.
