When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are using a different computer or if there is another person working on your project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that you can decide if the changes are what you want before it is automatically added.
