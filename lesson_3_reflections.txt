When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you are using a different computer or if there is another person working on your project. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that you can decide if the changes are what you want before it is automatically added. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks are when you clone a repository from one github account to your own. clones are when you clone a repository from one git account to your computer and a branch is when you want to work on a repository without effecting a different one. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	It lets you see what changes you made since your last upload. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	I would have to make 2 saves and use bittorrent sync. It would be more simple but will not be able to have commits and multiple saves will take a lot of disk space.
